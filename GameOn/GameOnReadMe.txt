Our website, "GameOn", is an all inclusive web site that contains information about video games. We have a games catalog, a news article seciton, and a newsletter subscription service in development.

How to navigate:

The site has a nav bar set up on the top of each page with quick links to any page of the web site. The nav bar has three options: 
	1) As an unregistered web browser, the nav bar gives the option of home, register, and sign in. 
	2) As a customer, the nav bar gives the option of home, games catalog, recent news, newsletter subscription, change password, and log out.
	3) As an admin, the nav bar gives the option of home, create catalog, create news article, create newsletter, preview newsletter, edit catalog entry, edit news article, edit newsletter, view subscribers, view users, games catalog, recent news, newsletter subscription, change password, and log out.

Sections completed, and sections under construction

Our group had three people, Zainab Akubat, Rich Hall, and Mozzam Khan. We divided our sections as follows:
	Zainab: Newsletter
	Rich: News
	Mozzam: Game Catalog

 

Username and Password to access each type of account. For example, what user and password to use for a "customer" or a "staff" user:

Rich
Admin: rmhall5@neiu.edu / fsef15g4
Guest: rmhall5customer@neiu.edu / fsef15g4

Some things to know: We need to finish the edit, but will not effect the customer experience.
